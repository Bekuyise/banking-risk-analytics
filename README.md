#  Banking Risk Analytics 


#  Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world use case in the banking and financial services sector, where data analytics is used to assess customer creditworthiness and minimize loan default risk. I built a complete end-to-end risk analytics solution using Power BI, Python, and SQL, enabling financial institutions to make informed, data-driven lending decisions.

##  Business Problem

### A bank must evaluate loan applicants based on various risk factors such as income, engagement history, and advisor relationships. 

### Challenges include:

 Lack of visibility into customer credit risk

 Manual and inconsistent approval processes

 Poor segmentation for targeting and risk profiling

##  Project Objective

To build a data analytics solution that cleans, transforms, and visualizes customer and banking data to support risk profiling, improve loan approval processes, and reduce potential financial losses.
